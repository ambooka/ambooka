I have built production-grade applications such as "CloudCommerce" (handling 100K+ concurrent users) and "AfriPay" (a unified mobile money API), demonstrating my ability to write efficient, maintainable code that scales.

**Financial Technology Experience:** My background includes designing secure payment integration platforms and working on digital services. I understand the critical importance of data integrity, security, and transaction reliability in financial software—skills that directly match the responsibilities outlined in your job posting.

I am eager to contribute to your team's success while continuing to grow my skills under the mentorship of experienced lead and senior engineers.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Maseno University and continuously invest in professional development, holding an AWS Solutions Architect certification. I am excited about the prospect of bringing my technical skills, dedication to quality, and collaborative spirit to Montran.
